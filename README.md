## Description
The building of this project is based around the use of node.js with an added inquirer (npm 8.2.4). Under the loading of "node /index.js" in your pc's intergrated terminal the user will be able to fill out a questionnaire which will upon completion
generate a README.md file with all the neccessary headings, content and corresponding licenses. ( Have attatched screenshots of code above ).

## Usage
* Using this project is very straight forward and first time user friendly, ensure you have your Node.js installed along with the "inquirer i @8.2.4" before running the program in your intergrated terminal.
* Open your intergrated terminal and perform your "node /index.js" this will run your index.js file and begin the README.md generator questionnaire.
* Upon completing the questionnaire the "generateMarkdown.js" code will execute and your responses will be forwarded and formatted into a newly generated README.md file in the corresponding "create" folder which can be reviewed for any errors and/or additions before pushing up to your remote GitHub repository.
* Both the "index.js" and "generateMarkdown.js" follow the exact same semantic coding structure for easy user interactability. A comprehensible coding structure also allows other developers an easier understanding of how the code interacts with one another which can be used for future use and/or revision.
